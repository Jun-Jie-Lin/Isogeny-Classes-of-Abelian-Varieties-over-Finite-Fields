# Isogeny-Classes-of-Abelian-Varieties-over-Finite-Fields

This repository contains the code used to check the results in the MSc of the same name by me
The checks for dimension 3 were done for up to q = 8, while those for dimensions 4 and 5 were done up to q = 5 due to the LMFDB not yet having a list of isogeny classes
